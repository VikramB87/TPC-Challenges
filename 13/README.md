*Sparse Number*

A number is called a 'sparse number' if its binary representation doesn't have any consecutive 1s.
For example, 40 is a sparse number since its binary representation 101000 doesn't have any consecutive 1's, but 22 is not sparse.
Write a program, which given a number returns the next sparse number.

Input: The input consists of the number of test cases, followed by the input numbers (Xn)
Output: The next sparse number for in the inputs.

Constraints: 1 <= Xn <= 1073741824
